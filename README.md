# Code Review -> Matthew
* I used the website, and the password section isn't a password field, and it shows the password text which is not common.   Might want to fix that in the future to hide the characters
* You have used alerts for when actions are completed, which isn't good user experience.
* Can there be two users with the same information?  I just registered a username twice
* I like the dashboard page colors, it's really vibrant and clean
* Is it intentional I can add weights from the past?  I assume it was cause it's not a problem if that's the case
* Is there a way to logout?  It's not clear, and if there is no way to log out there probably should be
